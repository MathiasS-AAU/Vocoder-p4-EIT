ERROR:Pack:2309 - Too many bonded comps of type "IOB" found to fit this device.
ERROR:Pack:2412 - The number of logical LUT blocks exceeds the capacity for the target device.
ERROR:Pack:2744 - This design requires at least 2048 SLICEMs for LUTRAMs. The target device has only 360 SLICEM sites. Please modify the
   logical design source to reduce the number of LUTRAMs. 
   As an alternative, please select a device with more SLICEM sites.
ERROR:Map:237 - The design is too large to fit the device.  Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device. Note that the number of slices reported may not be reflected accurately as
   their packing might not have been completed.

      Number using O5 output only:               3
      Number using O5 and O6:                  471
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                  16,384 out of   1,440 1137% (OVERMAPPED)
      Number used as Dual Port RAM:              0
      Number used as Single Port RAM:       16,384
        Number using O6 output only:        16,384
        Number using O5 output only:             0
        Number using O5 and O6:                  0
      Number used as Shift Register:             0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       624 out of   2,860   21%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       19,787
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:        19,324 out of  19,787   97%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 401 out of  19,787    2%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          62 out of  19,787    1%
    Number of unique control sets:             270
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              34 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
